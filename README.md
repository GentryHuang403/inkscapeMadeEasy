# inkscapeMadeEasy

<img src="docs/imagesDocs/samples_01.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>

This set of python modules is intended to extend Aaron Spike's inkex.py module, adding functions to help the development of new extensions for inkscape <https://inkscape.org>.

Here you will find methods and classes to deal with drawings, styles, markers, texts, plots, etc. It is a work-in-progress project and new features will be added in the future. However there is no roadmap right now.

This project is not intended to provide an end-user inkscape extension by itself but to provide easier backstage functions and classes to facilitate the development of inkscape extensions.

For end-user extensions see my other projects on GitHub (more to come soon):

-createMarkers  <https://github.com/fsmMLK/createMarkers>

Historically this project started as a way to help myself while creating extensions, namely focusing on scientific/academic diagrams and graphs. Therefore these modules do not intend to provide an extensive array of functions and classes to cover all possibilities of configurations, styles and etc. The modules were born and expanded as I felt the necessity to have new functions to help my workflow. Due to this, there might be other modules with similar/better features that I didn't find before.

Enough mumbo-jumbo. Let's start! =D
